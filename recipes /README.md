A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Item	Quantity	
Chicken (70-80g pieces)	1 kg	
Salt (Rock Salt/Rallu Uppu)	1 Tbsp	
Red Chili Powder	2 Tbsp	
Ginger-Garlic Paste	1.5 Tbsp	
Chopped Coriander Leaves (no stems)	1/2 cup
Chota Garam Masala (Small Spice Blend)	As prepared below	
Saffron (Kesar)	~0.5 gram	
Lemon Juice	1 whole lemon	
Fried Onions	1 handful
Curd (Yogurt)	200 grams	
Secret Masala Paste	Entire quantity (as prepared below)	
Oil	150 ml
Ghee (Clarified Butter)	Added at the end of mixing	
Hot Water (added just before dum)	100-150 ml

A. Prepare the Chota Garam Masala
Grind the 8 cardamoms, 4 cloves, and 2 inches of cinnamon stick into a rough powder 

Add the Shahjeera and grind again to create the Chota Garam Masala. Set aside.

B. First Stage of Chicken Marination
In a bowl, combine the 1 kg chicken with 1 Tbsp salt, 2 Tbsp red chili powder, 1.5 Tbsp ginger-garlic paste, 1/2 cup chopped coriander leaves, and the prepared Chota Garam Masala 

Mix/massage well until all the spices thoroughly coat the chicken.

Let the chicken rest for 20 minutes 

C. Prepare the Secret Masala Paste
In a pressure cooker, combine all the ingredients listed under Secret Masala Paste (coriander bunch, green chillies, ginger, garlic, tomato, cashews, whole spices, mint, fenugreek leaves, rose petals, turmeric, soy sauce, oil, and water) 

Cover the cooker and cook for 5 whistles 

Cool the boiled mixture completely, then grind it into a very fine paste 

D. Final Marination & Rice Soaking
Soak 1 kg of Basmati Rice for a minimum of 1 hour (up to 3 hours is fine) 

To the 20-minute rested chicken, add the saffron, the juice of one lemon, a handful of fried onions, and 200g of curd 

Add the entire Secret Masala Paste to the chicken 

Massage the chicken well to incorporate the cooked fenugreek aroma 

Add 150 ml of oil and mix for one minute 

Add ghee and mix well 

The final marinade time should be a minimum of 3 to 4 hours 

E. Cooking the Rice
After marination, add 100-150 ml of hot water to the chicken and arrange the leg pieces towards the edges of the pot 

In a separate pot, boil 3 liters of water. Add 6 Tbsp of salt, the rice spices (crushed cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon, Shahjeera, mint, coriander), 4 Tbsp of oil, and the juice of one lemon 

Once the water boils, add the soaked rice 

Cook the rice until it is 80% done (slightly firm) 

Strain the rice and gently spread it evenly over the marinated chicken in the pot 

F. Dum Process
Garnish the top of the rice with chopped coriander leaves 

Mix any remaining Secret Masala gravy/residue (from the cooker) with some of the rice cooking water and sprinkle it over the rice (or sprinkle hot water mixed with oil/ghee) 

Drizzle 2 Tbsp of ghee over the top layer of rice

Seal the pot tightly with silver foil 

Cook on high flame for exactly 5 minutes 

Place a heavy tawa/pan on the stove, set the biryani pot on top of it, and cook on dum for 20 minutes 

Turn off the stove and let it rest for another 20 minutes before opening and mixing.
